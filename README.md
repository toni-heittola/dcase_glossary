# Glossary for Computational Audio Content Analysis

The glossary collects key terms from the field of **computational audio content analysis**, and it can be accessed [here](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~heittolt/glossary).
This repository provides the data file used to generate the glossary for easier collaboration and attribution.  

Glossary is stored in `glossary.yaml` file and is meant to be used with [pelican-bglossary](https://github.com/toni-heittola/pelican-bglossary) plugin in [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) static site generator. 

The glossary does not try to be complete, as it is **work in progress**. If you see an error, or you want to contribute just make a pull request or [send me email](mailto:toni.heittola@tuni.fi).

The primary aim of this glossary is to provide Finnish translations for key terms in this field to stabilize the terminology. In order to make it usable also for others than finnish researchers, brief English definition is added for each term with links to Wikipedia and Wiktionary. Furthermore, some of the terms have been translated to German, Spanish and French through Wikipedia.

Special thanks for [Tomasz Mąka](http://quefrency.org/tmaka/index.html) for the Polish translations, and [Irene Martin Morato](https://www.tuni.fi/en/irene-martinmorato) for the Spanish translations.
